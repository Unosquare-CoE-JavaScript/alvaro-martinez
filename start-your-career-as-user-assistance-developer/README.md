and/or how to:
- install
- set up and configure
- use
- maintain
- dispose of


It is a discipline is performed by professional, most often referred to as " technical writer" or simply "author"


"professional information communicator" -> has the task  -> transfer information between two or more parties
- any medium that best facilities the transfer and comprehension of the information
-  research and create information

create strategies for presenting this information to the users



Technical writing is not a title job, is a skill that will help you to move forward in your career





results from technical writing 

deliverables results from the work of the technical writing
- user guide (a manual)
- quick start guide
- checklist
- instructional video, etc


what is the job of the technical writer ?
- planning
- preparing
- creating
- structuring and organizing
- classifying
- delivering
- maintaining

### functional documentation 

- Suitable for just getting started with a new product 
- explains what you see in front of you
- helps to find your way through the product
- often used for physical products



note: not spend too much time on functional documentation in software documentation

Strategy for writing functional documentation
1. start with teh first screen
2. describe pages and there intended use
3. describe what the customers see on the screen
4. organize the content in the order it appears on the user interface (

### task oriented documentation
- suitable for advance usage of a product
- barely explains what you see in front of tou, instead focuses on how to achieve a certain result.
- helps to find your way through the product or across multiple related products
- often used for software products
- guides you through the steps of a process
### strategies for writing task-oriented documentation
1. identify the task that the customer needs to perform 
2. sequence them in a logical order
3. add supporting concepts and information that the customers needs to know
4. add supporting reference information that helps them later on, ones they know the products better


## Technical writers in software development world
For the customers:
- helping users to effectively set up and use software
- assisting the users in solving a problem by themselves
- Making customers happy when using the software
For the software development team:
- saving time and energy of the development team


Technical writers deliverable can take the form of:
- a user guide
- API documentation 
- An instructional video or image, voice instruction or other type of multimedia - anything that assist the user into finding his or her  way through the software
- metadata, provided to a machine for search and retrieval of the information


process:
customer collects and organizes the requirements for development
- design the ui
- develops the software functionality and test implementation
and  technical writer:
- writes and prepares documentation delivery
- reviews string on the screen
- creates proposals for embedded information
- creates instructional videos
- creates graphics
### technical writing process
1. research and collect information
2. begin writing all down "dump information"
3. begin to structure and organize the information draft
4. present to stakeholders and collect feedback
5. reflect the feedback in the documentation
6. prepare final delivery
7. publish
8. collect customers feedback and maintain the documentation

## how to use a style guide
### or standards and guidelines for writing
- What s a style guide? why do you need to care about the writing style in technical writing?
- which are some common style guides you can re-use already for writing software documentation?
- what are some common style tules you must apply in your software documentation writing ?
- how far should you go applying the rules of a style guide in your company?

## why do we need standard for writing?
- branding reasons - match styles of writing with the company brand
- we want to bring content that looks and is perceived as consistent and clear from the users
- we need to define rules that allow us to bring clear information to the target users

## sample style guides


as simple as 

1. define the guidelines for writing 
	- headings - THIS IS A HEADING
	- paragraphs - with an empty paragraph between them
	- sections - area allowed. sentence style, bold, no full stop at the end
	- bulleted list:
		- para 1 
		- para 2
		- para 3
	- numbered list :
	1. para 1
	2. para 2
	3. para 3
 



## who needs style guides for writing
- user assistance developer(technical communicator or technical writer
- content editor)
- translator
- software architect
- product owner
- software developer
- usability experts (UX)

## results from using a style guide
- well organized content
- simplicity
- conciseness
- preciseness

## good organization/structure
 structure your content logically. pay attention to how you will organize
 - headings
 - paragraphs
 - sections
 - tables
 - bullets lists
 - numbered list

### conciseness 
- avoid redundancies
- link to information instead of copying text
- use visual aids(diagrams, schemes, screenshots, etc)

### simplicity
- use simple language and grammar
- use short sentences
- use positive formulations
- don't use ling series of nouns that modify one another or an long series of prepositional phrases. instead, split them up into smaller manageable parts

### precision
write true information
use correct and consistent terminology
use correct navigation paths
use correct product or components names

## verb choice
use precise verbs 

can or may ? 
can = possible for the user or the system
may or might = possible state or outcome


- MUST = an absolute requirement
- MUST NOT = "shall not" - absolute prohibition
- SHOULD = "recommended" - there may exist valid reasons in some circumstances to ignore a particular item
- SHOULD NOT = "not recommended"
- MAY = "optional "
## active voice and present tense

- use active voice. passive voice -> no info who is doing what to whom or to what
- if appropriate for text type and context, address the user directly with "you"
- define clearly who does what (the user, the application, the system admin)


## terminology
discuss terminology together with devs, pos ui
use correct and consistent terms
be careful inventing you own terms or jargon
do not use the same word to mean different things -> umbrella terms 


## consider in addition
- contractions (don't, can't, mustn't) -> decide depending on your style
- humor -> avoid - what sounds funny to you might be offending to others
- gender -> do not assume the gender of your users; use formulations such " him or her", or "his or hers"
- jargon words or idioms  -> avoid them

## use tools
- use a spell-checker
- search for existing terms/expressions on the web

## ui messages and text on screen


# structure writing
### why do we need structure in writing?
- organizing large mount of content
- maintaining an orderly structure to provide a consistent
- providing user with a more intuitive an obvious experience
- ensuring the completeness of documentation
- targeting content to varying audiences
- coordinating writing projects among a group of writers
- maximizing the efficiency with which documentation can be understood and used

Structuring writing is a form of technical writing that uses and creates structured documents

The term was coined by robert E Horn. Horn and colleges identified dozens of common documentation types, then analyzed them into structural components called information blocks. they identified over 200 common block types. These were assembled into information types using information maps


### common information types
the seven mos common information types are:
- concept
- procedure
- process
- principle
- fact
- structure
- and classification


### DITA XML a standar for structure writing
The common information types are loosely related to the three basic information types in Darwin information Typing architecture (DITA) XML topic types:
- concept
- task
- reference
Dita topics are assembled into documents using DITA maps


### how to structure in an unstructured writing environment?
define and use topic templates to represent the structure of the information


Structuring documents in MS word

M;S word is not a tool recommended for technical writing. string, if you need to use it define topics templates
instructor's sample templates can be downloaded from here: jpdocu.ck.page/ninja



### Structured writing in github wiki
- can be emulated using titles
- can be done using multiples pages or a single wikipage with TOC


## 12 Principles of technical writing 
- softskills
- hardskills:   all those skills related with the actual writing
	- excel

- decide whom are you writing for
- Identify the information needs of  your user
- Decide how  you are going to address your user - which style to apply   
- Decide which deliverables to create
- Decide which tool to use to create  your content
- Define the content structure
- Decide which  information channels  to use
- Write the documentation
- Use images or videos when  appropriate
- publish the first version
- Collect feedback  and improve
- Repeat



# DITA
	OASIS Darwin Information Typing Architecture Technical committee
	

## what is  structured writing ? 
It is a form of technical writing  that uses and  creates  structured documents 

### why  do we need structure in writing?
SW has been developed to address  common problems  in complex writing:

- organizing large amounts of material
- maintaining an orderly structure  to provide  a consistent experience to users
- providing users with a more intuitive  and obvious experience
- ensuring  the completeness of documentation
- targeting content to varying audiences 
- coordinating  writing  projects  among a group of writers
- organizing  each chunk  of content  in an intuitive  way
- Organizing  pages  of content  in a way that helps  users understand its place in the whole body of knowledge
- Maximizing the efficiency with which documentation can be understood and use 

### DITA
the names  derives from the following  concepts:
- Darwin:  it uses the principles of  specialization and inheritance 
- Information typing , which means each topic  has a defined  primary objective(procedure,glossary entry, troubleshooting ) 
- Architecture: DITA is an extensible set of structures 


### information types of DITA
- concept
	- Answer "what is ...?" questions. UYse the concept topic to introduce  the background  or overview information  for task  and reference topics 
- task
	- Answer "how do i...?" questions, and have well-defined structure  that describes how to complete a procedure to accomplish a specific goal.
		- use the task topic to describe the steps of a particular task or provide  an overview of a higher-level task
		- include  sections for describing  the context, prerequisites , actual steps, expected results, example and expected next steps
- reference
	- describe factual  material about  a subject, such as the commands in a programming  language.
	- the format  is also suitable for bibliographies, catalogues, the list of ingredients for recipes,  and similar  collections of structured descriptive  prose


### Authoring in DITA
- based on information types (tasks, concepts, references)
- deliverables structure is organize outside the topic  - via  maps
- implies that the author shall follow  strict rules  for writing
- modularized and usable
- context-free

### information Architecture  in DITA
- different levels of content reuse - deliverable, maps, topic, topic element
- enables the development of linking strategy
- filtering  and flagging of the final deliverable,based on profiling values
- Construct taxonomies for the purpose of constructing controlled vocabularies, or to define new classification subjects(metadata) for your content



## Using graphics 
- why do you need graphics ? when use a graphics?
	- when you needs to explain  set of complex steps or architecture
	-  
- types of graphics in technical writing 
- using  tools to easily create graphics



### Rules for graphics in technical writing 
- always explain  whats  in the graphic using text
- Adhere to rules for accessibility
	- image ALT text
	- colors that does not confuse  or affect people  with  color blindness
- use consistent colors and styles across the documentation, as per  your company style guide 
- Consider translatability options for your images  


## Strategies 
### What is information architecture ?
it is a structural design of shared information environments

the art and science  of organizing  and labeling websites, intranets,online communities, and software to support usability and findability

### who is an information architect?
that person that defines , design adn implements and applies  information architecture solutions allowing  your information organization  to be flexible, reusable and scalable.

### what do we talk about Info Arch ?  
questions to ask yourself?
- do you want  your documentation to be found in internet?
- do you want  to be  able to reuse  document  in different  deliverables ?
- do you want  to allow  authors to work  on different projects?
- do you want to  reduce  learning curve for entering  a new project ?

 ### information architecture and technical writing 
 information architecture ease the work for technical writers by: 
 - providing  a consistent working environment 
 - enabling and fostering  reuse
 - consulting  authors and helping  them solve problems related with organization and document delivery

### IA + TW = IAACC

information architecture practices applied  in technical  communication allows  you achieve  much more:
- IA facilities  the information creation process
- IA reduces efforts  for information creation
- IA plus KM allows  you prepare to deliver more - flexible information deliverables

 ### information architecture thinking patters for authors  
 - target users 
 - consumption patterns
 - product standard(s)
 - update cycles

recipe 
- customers first 
- standards
- deliveries
- deliveries channels
- organize it logically
- reuse the content
- identify organizational patterns


Simplicity
- use simple language and grammar
- use short sentences
- use positive formulations
- Do not use long series of nouns that modify one  another  or lon  series  of prepositional phrases. instead, split  them up into smaller, manageable  parts.
- use american english
