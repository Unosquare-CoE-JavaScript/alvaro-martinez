## Observer

The Observer design pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

###Â Advantage

- It describes the coupling between the objects and the observer.
- It provides the support for broadcast-type communication.

### Usage

- When the change of a state in one object must be reflected in another object without keeping the objects tight coupled.
- When the framework we writes and needs to be enhanced in future with new observers with minimal chamges.
