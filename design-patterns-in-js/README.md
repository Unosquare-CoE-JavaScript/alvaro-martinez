# Patterns design

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms

## Classification

### Creational patterns

These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

- Abstract
- factory
- Builder
- Factory
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Structural Patterns

These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

- Chain of responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template method
- Visitor
