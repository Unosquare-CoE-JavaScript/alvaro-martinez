## Flyweight

Flyweight pattern is one of the structural design patterns as this pattern provides ways to decrease object count thus improving application required objects structure.
Flyweight pattern is used when we need to create a large number of similar objects (say 105). One important feature of flyweight objects is that they are immutable. This means that they cannot be modified once they have been constructed.

###Â Advantage of Flyweight Pattern

- It reduces the number of objects.
- It reduces the amount of memory and storage devices required if the objects are persisted

Usage of Flyweight Pattern

- When an application uses number of objects
- When the storage cost is high because of the quantity of objects.
- When the application does not depend on object identity.
