## bridge

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

### advantages

- It enables the separation of implementation from the interface.
- It improves the extensibility.
- It allows the hiding of implementation details from the client.
