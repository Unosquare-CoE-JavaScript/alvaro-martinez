## Composition

Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.

### Advantage of Composite Design Pattern

- It defines class hierarchies that contain primitive and complex objects.
- It makes easier to you to add new kinds of components.
- It provides flexibility of structure with manageable class or interface.

It is used:

- When you want to represent a full or partial hierarchy of objects.
