## prototype

Prototype pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

This pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly.

###Â Advantage

The main advantages of prototype pattern are as follows:

- It reduces the need of sub-classing.
- It hides complexities of creating objects.
- The clients can get new objects without knowing which type of object it will be.
- It lets you add or remove objects at runtime.

### Usage

- When the classes are instantiated at runtime.
- When the cost of creating an object is expensive or complicated.
- When you want to keep the number of classes in an application minimum.
- When the client application needs to be unaware of object creation and representation.
