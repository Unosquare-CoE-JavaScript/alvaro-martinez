## Facade

Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an interface to existing system to hide its complexities.

This pattern involves a single class which provides simplified methods required by client and delegates calls to methods of existing system classes.

Advantage of Facade Pattern

- It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.
- It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.

Usage of Facade Pattern:

It is used:

- When you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system.
- When several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
